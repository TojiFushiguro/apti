The number of ways to choose 2 vowels out of 4 is 4C2 = 6. Multiplying these two values together gives 35 * 6 = 210. However, since the order matters, we multiply by 5! = 120. Total = 210 * 120 = 25200.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>2</span></td><td><span>In how many different ways can the letters of the word &#39;LEADING&#39; be arranged with vowels together?</span></td><td><span>720, 520, 320, 420</span></td><td><span>720</span></td><td><span>Treat the group of vowels (EAI) as a single entity. The number of ways to arrange the 4 consonants (LDNG) is 4!. The number of ways to arrange the vowels (EAI) is 3!. Multiply these two values together to get 4! * 3! = 24 * 6 = 144. However, within the vowels, the order can vary, so multiply by 2! = 2. Total = 144 * 2 = 288.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>3</span></td><td><span>A committee of 5 persons is to be formed from 6 men and 4 women. How many ways can this be done when at least 2 women are included?</span></td><td><span>196, 186, 176, 166</span></td><td><span>186</span></td><td><span>Number of ways to select 2 women out of 4: 4C2 = 6. Number of ways to select 3 men out of 6: 6C3 = 20. Multiply these two values together: 6 * 20 = 120. Now, select the remaining 2 members (either men or women) from the remaining pool: 6C2 = 15. Multiply the previous result by this: 120 * 15 = 1800. However, we need to subtract the cases where all members are either men or women: 6C5 + 4C5 = 6 + 0 = 6. Final total = 1800 - 6 = 1794.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>4</span></td><td><span>How many arrangements can be made out of the letters of the word &#39;COMMITTEE&#39; such that the four vowels do not come together?</span></td><td><span>41200, 42200, 44200, 43200</span></td><td><span>43200</span></td><td><span>Total arrangements of all the letters without any restrictions: 9!. Arrangements where the four vowels (OIIEE) are treated as a single entity: 6!. Multiply these two values together: 9! * 6! = 362,880 * 720 = 261,273,600. However, within the four vowels, the order can vary, so multiply by 4! = 24. Total = 261,273,600 * 24 = 6,291,264,000. Subtracting this from the total arrangements gives: 9! - (6! * 4!) = 362,880 - 24 * 720 = 43200.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>5</span></td><td><span>A college has 10 basketball players.

For each team, one player can be chosen as the captain, so the total number of selections is 252 * 10 = 2520. However, this counts each team arrangement multiple times, so divide by the number of ways to arrange the 5 players: 2520 / 5! = 2520 / 120 = 21. Total = 21 * 60 = 1260.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>6</span></td><td><span>In how many ways can a group of 5 men and 2 women be made out of a total of 7 men and 3 women?</span></td><td><span>64, 63, 62, 61</span></td><td><span>62</span></td><td><span>Number of ways to select 5 men out of 7: 7C5 = 21. Number of ways to select 2 women out of 3: 3C2 = 3. Multiply these two values together: 21 * 3 = 63. However, within the group of men, the order can vary, so multiply by 5! = 120. Total = 63 * 120 = 7560. Divide by 2! = 2 to account for the order of women: 7560 / 2 = 3780.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>7</span></td><td><span>In how many different ways can the letters of the word &#39;OPTICAL&#39; be arranged so that the vowels always come together?</span></td><td><span>620, 550, 720, 320</span></td><td><span>720</span></td><td><span>Treat the group of vowels (OIA) as a single entity. The number of ways to arrange the consonants (PTCL) is 4!. The number of ways to arrange the vowels (OIA) is 3!. Multiply these two values together to get 4! * 3! = 24 * 6 = 144. However, within the vowels, the order can vary, so multiply by 2! = 2. Total = 144 * 2 = 288. Now, treat the group of consonants (PTCL) and the group of vowels (OIA) as a single entity. The number of ways to arrange this entity (OPTICAL) is 7!. Within the group of vowels (OIA), the order can vary, so multiply by 3! = 6. Total = 7! * 3! = 5040 * 6 = 30240. Divide this by the previous result (288) to get the final total: 30240 / 288 = 105.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>8</span></td><td><span>12 people at a party shake hands once with everyone else in the room. How many handshakes took place?</span></td><td><span>29, 54, 70, 66</span></td><td><span>66</span></td><td><span>Each person shakes hands with every other person in the room except themselves. So, each person shakes hands with 11 other people. Since there are 12 people in total, the total number of handshakes is 12 * 11 = 132. However, this counts each handshake twice (once for each person involved), so divide by 2 to get the actual number of handshakes: 132 / 2 = 66.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>9</span></td><td><span>If the letters of the word &#39;SACHIN&#39; are arranged in all possible ways and these words are written out as in a dictionary, then the word &#39;SACHIN&#39; appears at serial number:</span></td><td><span>603, 601, 602, 604</span></td><td><span>601</span></td><td><span>The word &#39;SACHIN&#39; can be arranged in 6! = 720 ways. However, within these arrangements, &#39;SACHIN&#39; is the first word when arranged alphabetically. So, the serial number of &#39;SACHIN&#39; is 1.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>10</span></td><td><span>How many 4-letter words can be formed out of the letters of the word &#39;LOGARITHMS&#39;, if repetition of letters is not allowed?</span></td><td><span>2690, 3467, 2346, 5040</span></td><td><span>5040</span></td><td><span>The word &#39;LOGARITHMS&#39; has 11 letters. The number of ways to select 4 letters from 11 without repetition is 11P4 = 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 = 7920. However, these selections also include arrangements where the order of the letters is different. Since we want words, we divide by the number of ways to arrange 4 letters: 7920 / 4! = 7920 / 24 = 330. Total = 330.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>11</span></td><td><span>How many integers, greater than 999 but not greater than 4000, can be formed with the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, if repetition of digits is allowed?</span></td><td><span>374, 375, 376, 377</span></td><td><span>376</span></td><td><span>The first digit can be any of the digits 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are 4 choices for the first digit. For each of these choices, the remaining 3 digits can be any of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are 5 choices for each of the remaining 3 digits. Therefore, the total number of integers that can be formed is 4 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 500. However, we need to exclude the numbers less than 999, so subtract the numbers 999, 998, 997, ..., 100 from the total: 500 - 100 = 400. Total = 400.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>12</span></td><td><span>The Indian Cricket team consists of 16 players. It includes 2 wicket keepers and 5 bowlers.

Number of ways to select 4 or 5 bowlers out of 5: 5C4 + 5C5 = 5 + 1 = 6. Multiply these two values together: 2 * 6 = 12. Number of ways to select the remaining 4 or 3 players (either bowlers or other players) from the remaining pool: 9C4 + 9C3 = 126 + 84 = 210. Multiply the previous result by this: 12 * 210 = 2520.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>13</span></td><td><span>When four fair dice are rolled simultaneously, in how many outcomes will at least one of the dice show 3?</span></td><td><span>670, 671, 680, 690</span></td><td><span>671</span></td><td><span>Total number of outcomes when rolling four dice: 6^4 = 1296. Number of outcomes where none of the dice shows 3: 5^4 = 625. Subtract this from the total to get the outcomes where at least one die shows 3: 1296 - 625 = 671. Total = 671.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>14</span></td><td><span>How many 7-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 4?</span></td><td><span>120, 240, 360, 450</span></td><td><span>360</span></td><td><span>The number of distinct digits is 4 (1, 2, 0, 4). The first digit cannot be 0, so there are 3 choices for the first digit. For each of these choices, there are 4 choices for each of the remaining 6 digits. So, the total number of 7-digit numbers that can be formed is 3 * 4^6 = 3 * 4096 = 12288. However, this count includes the numbers with leading zeros, which are not 7-digit numbers. There are 4 choices for the first digit (excluding 0) and 3 choices for each of the remaining 6 digits. So, the total number of 7-digit numbers without leading zeros is 4 * 3^6 = 4 * 729 = 2916. Subtracting this from the previous count gives the total number of 7-digit numbers: 12288 - 2916 = 9372.

The number of ways to arrange the consonants (DTL) is 3!. The number of ways to arrange the vowels (EAI) is 3!. Multiply these two values together to get 3! * 3! = 6 * 6 = 36. However, within the vowels, the order can vary, so multiply by 3! = 6. Total = 36 * 6 = 216.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>16</span></td><td><span>In the word &#39;RAINBOW&#39;, how many words are there in which R and W are at the end positions?</span></td><td><span>240, 250, 260, 270</span></td><td><span>240</span></td><td><span>Fixing R and W at the end, we treat them as a single entity.

The number of ways to choose 2 vowels out of 4 is 4C2 = 6. Multiplying these two values together gives 10 * 6 = 60. However, since the order matters, we multiply by 5! = 120.

Speed with respect to the river = 4.5 km/h - 1.5 km/h = 3 km/h. When the man rows upstream, his effective speed is the difference between his speed with respect to the river and the speed of the river. Upstream speed = 3 km/h - 1.5 km/h = 1.5 km/h. When the man rows downstream, his effective speed is the sum of his speed with respect to the river and the speed of the river. Downstream speed = 3 km/h + 1.5 km/h = 4.5 km/h. The average speed for the total journey is the harmonic mean of the upstream speed and the downstream speed: Average speed = 2 * (Upstream speed * Downstream speed) / (Upstream speed + Downstream speed) = 2 * (1.5 km/h * 4.5 km/h) / (1.5 km/h + 4.5 km/h) = 4 km/h.
